## Overview

Welcome to the BigData Project: End-to-End repository! This project is a comprehensive solution for handling large-scale data processing using various Big Data technologies. Whether you're a data engineer, data scientist, or anyone interested in working with big data, this repository provides a versatile platform for end-to-end data processing.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Efficiently ingest large volumes of data from various sources.
- **Data Processing:** Perform complex data transformations and processing tasks.
- **Storage:** Store processed data in scalable and fault-tolerant storage systems.
- **Analytics:** Conduct analytics and gain insights from the processed data.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the results to make data-driven decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** For distributed storage.
- **Apache Spark:** For distributed data processing.
- **Apache Hive:** For data warehousing and SQL-like queries.
- **PostgreSQL:** For NoSQL database capabilities.
- **Azure Blob Storage:** For stream processing.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **[Hadoop Installation](./Hadoop_Setup.md):** Contains code for ingesting data from various sources.
- **[PostgreSQL Installation](./PostgreSQL_Setup.md):** Includes code for processing and transforming data using Apache Spark and Apache Flink.
- **[Hive Installation](./Hive_Setup.md):** Contains configurations and scripts for setting up storage systems like HDFS, Hive, and HBase.
- **[Spark Installation](./Spark_Setup.md):** Includes code for performing analytics on the processed data.
- **[visualization](./visualization):** Contains scripts and code for visualizing the analytics results.
