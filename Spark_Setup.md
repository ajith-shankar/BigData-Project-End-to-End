# Apache Spark Setup Instructions

This guide outlines the steps to set up Apache Spark for the BigData Project: End-to-End. Apache Spark is a distributed data processing framework that provides fast in-memory data processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Spark setup process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Spark runs on Java, so ensure you have the latest JDK installed on your system. Download and install it from the official Oracle website, or refer to the project's [hadoop_setup.md](./Hadoop_Setup.md) for Java setup instructions.

- **Hadoop:** Although Spark doesn't require Hadoop to run, it is often used in conjunction with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Refer to the project's [hadoop_setup.md](./Hadoop_Setup.md) for Hadoop setup instructions.
